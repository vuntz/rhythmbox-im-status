IM Status - Rhythmbox plugin - 0.7
==================================

Author: Vincent Untz <vuntz@gnome.org>
Licence: GPLv2
Main bzr branch: http://www.vuntz.net/bzr/rhythmbox-plugins/

This Rhythmbox plugin updates the status in various IM clients (Empathy and
Gossip are currently supported) according to the current playing song.

Here is the list of known bugs:

 + with Gossip <= 0.22: when you deactivate the plugin, or quit Rhythmbox,
   your status is set to "". This has been fixed in Gossip. See
   http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=410398 for details.

 + with Empathy and some old version of mission-control: the plugin doesn't
   work because mission-control didn't emit a signal when the status message is
   changed but the status itself doesn't change. This has been fixed in later
   releases of mission-control.

** Installation **

To install this plugin, you only have to copy the plugin directory to
~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins/im-status

It should just work when you enable it in the plugin dialog of Rhythmbox.
